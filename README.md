# Overview
This repository contains code for a project focused on pain detection using Vision Transformers on a subset of 2000 images from the BioVid dataset. 
The primary transformer encoder utilized in this project is FastVit from the Keras CV Attention Models repository (https://github.com/leondgarse/keras_cv_attention_models).
